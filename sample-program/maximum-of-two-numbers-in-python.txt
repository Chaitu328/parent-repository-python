Maximum of two numbers in Python

Given two numbers, write a Python code to find the Maximum of these two numbers.

Examples:

Input: a = 2, b = 4
Output: 4

Input: a = -1, b = -4
Output: -1

Method #1: This is the naive approach where we will compare tow numbers using if-else statement and will print the output accordingly.

Example:

def maximum(a, b): 

    if a >= b: 

        return a 

    else: 

        return b 

a = 2

b = 4

print(maximum(a, b)) 

Output:


4

Method #2: Using max() function

This function is used to find the maximum of the values passed as its arguments.

Example:

a = 2

b = 4

maximum = max(a, b) 

print(maximum) 

Output:

4
